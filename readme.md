This is an interactive website that uses html/css/javascript to create a mood garden journal. Users can write a journal entry on how their day went and then using a sentiment API the mood/emotion of those words are extracted and used to animate the garden. If the day is good then the flowers will grow and it will be sunny and if the day was bad it would be cloudy and the flowers would wilt.
